# A tool to convert ipynb to HTML in Colab
Using this tool you can convert your work in Colab to HTML and submit it as a report.    
Unlike R, Colab doesn't have an option to export the HTML format of our work as a report. Here is the tool that we developed to convert it easier.

## To use the tool directly, click this [link](https://githubtocolab.com/Mostafa-MR/Convert_ipynb_to_HTML_in_Colab/blob/main/Convert_ipynb_to_HTML_in_Colab.ipynb).

Enjoy it!
